# cmip6-to-wrf intermediate binary files (ungrib output)
# forked from https://github.com/lzhenn/cmip6-to-wrfinterm

 I have added miroc6 model to the code and monthly 'ps' files are merged to yearly file. then all 3hr files ('tas',''huss','mrsos') are conevrted to 6hr files. all of this are done internally.


# Notes from original author Zhenning LI

**CMIP6-to-WRFInterim** uses pure python implementation to convert CMIP6 sub-daily output into WRF intermediate files, which are used to drive the WRF model for regional dynamical downscaling usage.
Currently, only **MPI-ESM-1-2-HR** model has been teseted in **historical run and SSP1/2/5 scenarios**, you may need proper modifications for other model convension.

## Installation
Please install python3 using Anaconda3 distribution. [Anaconda3](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) with python3.8 and 3.9 has been deeply tested, lower version of python3 may also work (without testing). If `numpy`, `pandas`, `scipy`, `xarray`, `netcdf4` are properly installed, you may skip the installation step.

While, we recommend to create a new environment in Anaconda and install the `requirements.txt`:

```bash
conda create -n test_c2w python=3.9
conda activate test_c2w
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quick start

```bash
python3 run_c2w.py
```

If you successfully run the above command (it is okay to see some FutureWarnings), you should see `CMIP6:2100-01-02_00` and `CMIP6:2100-01-02_00` in the `./output` folder.
(See [Troubleshooting](https://github.com/lzhenn/cmip6-to-wrfinterm#troubleshooting) if you are a Windows Subsystem user.)
Copy or link the two intermidiate files to your WPS folder, prepare your **geo_em** files and setup your `namelist.wps` properly, now you are ready to run `metgrid.exe` and the following WRF procedures.

There is a simple example of `namelist.wps` and `namelist.input` covering the East Asian region in the `./sample` folder for testing.

If you run the sample case successfully, you are expected to see snapshots of the skin temperature in the initial condition and after 6-hour WRFv4.3 run as shown as above.


## Troubleshooting

**(Dec 19, 2022)**: Lack of suitable source variables from CMIP6 datasets to drive the dynamical downscaling are common. For example, the available 6-hour `ts` variable in SSP is missing in historical run of `MPI-ESM1-2-HR` output. We cannot directly map the `SST` by `ts`.
One trade-off is using the `tas` to represent both the land surface and sea surface temperature, just as you could find in the `MPI-ESM1-2-HR_HIST.csv` vtable. While this is not a good strategy. 
For accurate representation of sea surface temperature, you may need to use 3-hour `tos` variable and set `cmip_frq=3` in `config.ini` to generate the 3-hour SST in historical run (see the Vtable with suffix `SST`). Make sure to use a different `output_prefix` such as `SST`. (Thanks [Dr. Paul Nalon from ICHEC](https://www.ichec.ie/staff/paul-nolan-phd) and [Dr. Sium Gebremariam from PSU](http://www.met.psu.edu/people/stg5265) helping with this.) 

**(Nov 27, 2022)**: According to feedback from several users, if you are using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL, typically Ubuntu from Microsoft Store), please note Windows does **NOT** support colon ":" in the file name.
You may rename the output file name or try a pure Linux platform.

## Usage

### Modify config.ini

When you properly download the `MPI-ESM1-2-HR` data, First edit the `./conf/config.ini` file properly.

``` python
[INPUT]
input_root=./sample/ 
model_name=MPI-ESM1-2-HR
vtable_name=@model
exp_id = ssp585
esm_flag=r1i1p1f1
grid_flag=gn
#YYYYMMDDHHMM
cmip_strt_ts = 210001020000
cmip_end_ts = 210001020600
# In hours
cmip_frq=6

[OUTPUT]
#YYYYMMDDHHMM, please seperate your ETL processes if request very long-term simulation
etl_strt_ts = 210001020000
etl_end_ts = 210001020600
output_root = ./output/
output_prefix=CMIP6 
``` 
* `[INPUT]['input_root']` is the root directory of the CMIP6 data, here it points to the `./sample/` folder.
* `[INPUT]['model_name']` is the name of the model. Now only the `MPI-ESM-1-2-HR` model is supported. If you plan to use other models, you need to setup your own variable mapping table (see below).
* `[INPUT]['vtable_name']` Will assign which Vtable to use. This item will guide the script to read the corresponding variable mapping table in `./db/`. The seperation of model_name and vtable_name will be useful if you hope to replace some variables in the same model.

* `[INPUT]['exp_id']` `['esm_flag']` `['grid_flag']` are used to form the netCDF file name.
* `[INPUT]['cmip_strt_ts']` and `[INPUT]['cmip_end_ts']` are the start and end time of the CMIP6 data.
* `[OUTPUT]['etl_strt_ts']` and `[OUTPUT]['etl_end_ts']` are the start and end time of your desired ETL period.

After you have edited the `config.ini` file, you can run the script again for your desired period. The intemediate files will be generated in the `[OUTPUT]['output_root']` folder. 
Note that for `MPI-ESM-1-2-HR`, the soil properties between 10-200cm is not provided by the model and we overwrote it by 0-10cm soil properties, a special type mark of `2d-soilr` is provided in the varaible mapping table. You may need long-term (~1-month) spin-up run if your research requests accurate soil properties.


### [OPTIONAL] Modify ./db/${MODEL_NAME}.csv

`./db/${MODEL_NAME}.csv` records the model-specified variable mapping table. If you plan to use other models, you need to setup your own variable mapping table. 

``` javascript 
src_v,aim_v,units,type,lvlmark,desc
ta,TT,K,3d,PlevPt,3-d air temperature
hus,SPECHUMD,kg kg-1,3d,PlevPt,3-d specific humidity
ua,UU,m s-1,3d,PlevPt, 3-d wind u-component
va,VV,m s-1,3d,PlevPt, 3-d wind v-component
zg,GHT,m,3d,PlevPt, 3-d geopotential height
ps,PSFC,Pa,2d,Lev, Surface pressure
tas,TT,K,2d,PlevPt, 2-m temperature
uas,UU,m s-1,2d,PlevPt, 10m wind u-component
vas,VV,m s-1,2d,PlevPt, 10m wind v-component
ts,SKINTEMP, K,2d,PlevPt, Skin temperature
ts,SST, K,2d,PlevPt, sea surface temperature
psl,PMSL,Pa,2d,PlevPt, Mean sea-level pressure
huss,SPECHUMD, kg kg-1,2d,PlevPt, 2-m relative humidity
mrsos,SM000010, m3/m-3,2d-soil,PlevPt, 0-10 cm soil moisture
tsl,ST000010,K,2d-soil,PlevPt, 0-10 cm soil temp 
mrsos,SM010200, m3/m-3,2d-soilr,PlevPt, 10-200 cm soil moisture
tsl,ST010200,K,2d-soilr,PlevPt, 10-200 cm soil temp 
```
* `src_v` is the name of the variable in the CMIP6 data, which is also used to form the netCDF file name.
* `aim_v` is the name of the variable archived in WRF intermidiate file, which is used by `metgrid.exe`.
* `units` is the unit of the variable.
* `type` denotes the type of the variable. `3d` means 3-d variable, `2d` means 2-d variable, `2d-soil` means 2-d variable in the soil layer. Note that for `MPI-ESM-1-2-HR`, the soil properties between 10-200cm is not provided by the model and we overwrote it by 0-10cm soil, a special type mark of `2d-soilr` is provided here.
* `lvlmark` is the level mark of the variable. `PlevPt` means the variable is a 3-d variable with pressure level.
* `desc` is the description of the variable.

### [Advanced] cmip_handler.py

The core of the converter is `cmip_handler.py`. It is a Python module that handles the CMIP6 data and converts it to WRF intermidiate file. The module first load CMIP6 data according to the `config.ini` file, then it interpolates to regular latXlon mesh. Finally it convert the data to WRF intermidiate file. The module includes the following functions and classes:
```

Functions:
    gen_wrf_mid_template():
        Generate a WRF-Mid template dict for the WRF-Intermediate data.

    write_record(out_file, slab_dic):
        Write a record to a WRF intermediate file
    --------------------
    Classes:
    CMIPHandler():
        Construct CMIP Handler 

        Methods
        -------
        __init__:   initialize CMIP Handler with config and loading data
        interp_data: interpolate data to common mesh
        write_wrfinterm: write wrfinterm file

```

### [Appendix] Fetch Input Files

According to WRF Users Guide (v4.2), P3-36:
> **Required Meteorological Fields for Running WRF**
>> In order to successfully initialize a WRF simulation, the real.exe pre-processor requires a 
>> minimum set of meteorological and land-surface fields to be present in the output from 
>> the metgrid.exe program. Accordingly, these required fields must be available in the 
>> intermediate files processed by metgrid.exe. 

CMIP6 data can be downloaded from the [LLNL interface](https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/search/cmip6/), after cross-check the variable list from **MPI-ESM-1-2-HR** and the WRF required variables, we have the following table:
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Novarizark/cmip6-to-wrfinterm/master/fig/var_table.png)

You may setup your own variable mapping table in `./db/${MODEL_NAME}.csv` if you want to use other models.
